It’s been 2 years since my HumLUG presentation on "Internet in a Box”. Here’s a link to the slides. 

I’ve found that IIAB works better from a x86 machine rather than a Raspberry Pi, especially if you’re going to load up Open Street Maps and expect to be zooming around between the 10 levels of detail.

Today I got x86 IIAB resurrected  in it's April 2023 configuration and am now updating what content I can.

Questions about IIAB are welcome!
